# Hire-Me-Mailer 🚀

Hire-Me-Mailer is a lightweight Ruby on Rails application that helps job seekers send their resume to multiple HR email addresses efficiently using their **personal Gmail account**. It is built for speed, reliability, and simplicity — no paid email services required.

* 📧 Send the same email to **multiple HR emails** at once
* 📝 Rich-text email editor using **TinyMCE**
* 📎 Resume upload & automatic attachment
* 👀 **Email preview** before sending
* ⚙️ Background email delivery using **Sidekiq**

* 🧾 Email delivery logs (sent / failed / retried)
* 🧹 Auto-cleanup temporary resume files
* 🔐 Uses your **personal Gmail (App Password)**
* 💯 Completely **free & open-source**

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* Ruby on Rails 8
* Sidekiq + Redis
* Action Mailer (SMTP)
* TinyMCE
* SQLite (default)
* Gmail SMTP

---

## 📸 Use Case

Perfect for job seekers who want to:

* Reach multiple recruiters quickly
* Avoid copy-pasting emails
* Track email delivery status
* Stay within Gmail’s daily sending limits (e.g. 20/day)

---

## 🔐 Gmail Setup (Important)

Hire-Me-Mailer uses **Gmail App Passwords** (not your main Gmail password).

Steps:

1. Enable **2-Step Verification** in your Google account
2. Go to **Google Account → Security → App Passwords**
3. Generate an App Password for "Mail"
4. Use that password in the app configuration

---

## ⚙️ Configuration & Security

After the first login, each user can securely configure their own settings directly from the application.

### User Settings Include:

* 📧 **Gmail address** (used for sending emails)
* 🔐 **Gmail App Password** (never stored in plain text)
* 📝 **TinyMCE API key** (for rich email editing)

All credentials are stored securely at the user level and are never hard-coded or shared. This makes Hire-Me-Mailer fully **multi-user**, **safe**, and **personalized** without relying on environment variables.

---

## 📬 Email Flow

1. Fill the form with:

   * Multiple HR emails
   * Subject
   * Email body (rich text)
   * Resume upload
2. Preview the email
3. Submit → emails are queued via Sidekiq
4. Failed emails are retried automatically
5. All activity is logged

---

## ▶️ Running Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Hire-Me-Mailer.git
cd Hire-Me-Mailer
bundle install
rails db:setup
redis-server
bundle exec sidekiq
rails server
```

🔐 Rails Credentials Setup (Required)

Hire-Me-Mailer uses Rails Encrypted Credentials to securely store sensitive data.
If you are running this project locally for the first time, you must set up credentials.

⚠️ Important

If you clone this repository, the encrypted credentials file may already exist but cannot be decrypted without a matching key. This is expected and secure behavior.

✅ First-Time Setup (Local Development)
# Remove any existing encrypted credentials (local only)
```bash
rm config/credentials.yml.enc
```

# Create new credentials and encryption key
```bash
EDITOR="nano" bin/rails credentials:edit
```

This will:

1. Generate a new config/master.key
2. Create a fresh config/credentials.yml.enc
3. Open the credentials file for editing

🔐 Do NOT commit config/master.key
Save it in a password manager if needed.

Save in nano:

* Ctrl + O → Enter
* Ctrl + X

ℹ️ Note: Hire-Me-Mailer primarily stores sensitive values per user inside the database using Rails encryption, so credentials are optional for basic usage.

✅ Verify Credentials
```bash
bin/rails runner "puts Rails.application.credentials.config.inspect"
```

You should see a hash, not an error.
